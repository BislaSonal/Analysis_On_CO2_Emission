# Analysis_On_CO2_Emission
Big data project implemented in 2022 : Analysis on co2 emission

This project has been divided into 3 phases:

Phase 1 : Data Cleaning ( Tools used for this analysis are HDFS, PySpark and Tableau )

Phase 2 : Problem Statement Analysis ( Tools used for this analysis are Apache hive cluster on Databricks cloud platform, and Ambari for visualization )

Note : Problem statement question for phase 2 : Among the countries with the highest CO2 emissions, what factors contribute to their significant pollution levels?

Phase 3: Problem Statement Analysis (Tools used for this analysis are Elastic search & Kibana )

Note : Problem statement question for phase 3 : Does the analysis of CO2 emissions reveal a direct impact on life expectancy, or are there other factors that contribute to improvements in life expectancy?
